# TrialGPT
NB: I am a complete amateur and this is my first github project
I am trying out theOpenai Instructions
The whole idea here is to test the py that I got from ChatGPT4 to use an llm after a prompt I wrote which used the following prompt:
"write a software package in python3 to use the advantage of one of the approx 3.5 GB llms in order to query private pdf documents on own computer."
